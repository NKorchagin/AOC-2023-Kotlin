# AOC-2023-Kotlin

Welcome to the Advent of Code[^aoc] Kotlin project created by [nkorchagin][github] using the [Advent of Code Kotlin Template][template] delivered by JetBrains.

In this repository, nkorchagin is about to provide solutions for the puzzles using [Kotlin][kotlin] language.

> Note: All task input files are excluded from the repository with `.gitignore` – we should not post them publicly, as Eric Wastl asks for: [Tweet](https://twitter.com/ericwastl/status/1465805354214830081). Test inputs from AOC website are public and included to the repository.

If you're stuck with Kotlin-specific questions or anything related to this template, check out the following resources:

[^aoc]:
    [Advent of Code][aoc] – An annual event of Christmas-oriented programming challenges started December 2015.
    Every year since then, beginning on the first day of December, a programming puzzle is published every day for twenty-five days.
    You can solve the puzzle and provide an answer using the language of your choice.
